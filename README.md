The students memorize the words and undergo a test to see if they can spell the words without making mistakes
The students listen to audio generated from TTS
An image that summarizes the story will be generated to understand the story better, may take up to four images.
Grammar education of regular/irregular past tenses and past participles from the story

The students will use an application that can be used to check the past tense/past participle forms for the word that they enter
